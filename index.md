## Welcome to the homepage of Dr. Michael Fenton

Michael Fenton is a postdoctoral researcher in experimental high-energy physics at the University of California, Irvine and a member of the [ATLAS Collaboration](https://atlas.cern/) at [CERN](https://home.cern/).

Currently there isn't much here. Sorry!

Oh ok, have a short list of highlighted papers at least:

   - [Permutationless Many-Jet Event Reconstruction with Symmetry Preserving Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09206)
   - [SPANet: Generalized Permutationless Set Assignment for Particle Physics using Symmetry Preserving Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03898)
   - [Safety of Quark/Gluon Jet Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09103
   - [Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks and decaying into a bb¯ pair in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector](Measurements of top-quark pair differential cross-sections in the lepton+jets channel in pp collisions at s√=13 TeV using the ATLAS detector)
   - [Observation of Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair at the LHC with the ATLAS detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00425)
   - [Measurements of top-quark pair differential cross-sections in the lepton+jets channel in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV using the ATLAS detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00727)
